# Faculty-Cource Matching Algorithm

This is the final overview of an algorithm myself and my partner Ramya Madhuri Narapureddy created to propose an automated process of assigning professors from the Kennesaw State University Department of Computer Science to the needed courses for a semester. Using a hungarian matching algorthm, this algorithm took prior teaching experiance into account for assigments but could be adjusted to accommodate other conditions affecting the potential matching weights. 

Our data was sourced from prior semester KSU faculty-class pairings and is not publicly avalible to those who do not work for or attend Kennesaw State University.
